# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, which allows users to visualize different sorting algorithms with smooth animations and customizable speed. The project is based on the work of [TechPrep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZmHjo_BfGw) from his Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Tutorial.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: A variety of sorting algorithms are included, allowing you to see how they work step by step.
- **Customizable Animation Speed**: Adjust the speed of the sorting animation in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Pulse Animation**: After sorting is complete, the bars pulse to indicate that the sorting process has ended.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following algorithms are implemented in the visualizer:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if necessary.
- **Selection Sort**: This algorithm divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region, iteratively selecting the smallest element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.

- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next unsorted element and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion.

- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller sub-arrays, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together.

- **Quick Sort**: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm, Quick Sort selects a 'pivot' and partitions the array such that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all greater elements come after it.

## How to Use

1. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select a sorting algorithm from the options available in the control panel.
2. **Generate a New Array**: You can reset and generate a new array of random numbers by resizing the window or refreshing the page.
3. **Start the Sorting Animation**: Click the start button to see the algorithm in action. The bars will animate to reflect the sorting process.
4. **Adjust Animation Speed**: Use the slider to change how fast or slow the sorting animation occurs.
5. **Enjoy the Visualization**: Once sorting is complete, the bars will pulse to indicate that the sorting is done.
